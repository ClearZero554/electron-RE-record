# Electron Reverse Engineering Record
# Record of Reverse Engineering and Development on Some Electron Applications
I will place some Electron software that I consider garbage here and reverse-engineer it. The final product will be in the release section.

- I recently found a related software written in C++, and it seems to be more interesting to me, but this repository is only intended to host the reverse-engineered files for Electron.

 I have to re-evaluate this software; it has taken up far too much of my time, especially with the release notes. From uploading the ZIP package to finishing the release notes, it took me a full half-hour. That’s just too long—longer than it took me to reverse-engineer it. This is a real waste of my time, yet this   
 kind of junk software shouldn't drive me away just because it’s poorly made. My original intention was to eliminate these garbage Electron-based applications, but it seems to be taking longer than expected.I need to think about it.
